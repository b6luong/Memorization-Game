# Memorization-Game

This memorization game is to demonstrate inheritance and interfaces in Java.

## How the game works
The goal of the game is to try and match all of the tokens as fast as you can.
Some of the game tokens will be flashing and some will not. You can change the player's token pattern by right clicking and using left click to match the tokens.
